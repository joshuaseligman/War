# War-Card-Game
 
This program simulates the War card game.

This project was the final assignment for my Java development class and culminates everything I learned throughout the semester. The main concepts that I heavily concentrated on during this assignment were implementing stacks with linked lists, reading files, and writing good Javadoc documentation.

The program begins by asking the user for the path to a file that contains the information for the card deck. Files are supposed to consist of no more than 52 cards and represent each card with a value followed by the suit. Error checking was important here to make sure the appropriate information is obtained. Once the deck of cards is loaded, the computer simulates the game by comparing the next card in each player's deck. If there is a winner, both cards are moved to the winner's discard stack. If there is a tie, both players put their cards away into their respective discard stacks. If a player's main stack is empty, the cards in their discard stack are transferred over to their play stack. However, if both the play and discard stacks are empty, that player loses. The simulation continues until there is a clear winner or until 1,000 rounds are played. Once the simulation is over, the computer prints out a summary of the game which includes the number of cards in the deck, the number of rounds played, how many cards are left for each player, and who won the game.
